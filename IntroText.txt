Hi, my name is Alexandra.
This is my last semester here at Washtenaw Community College - my final classes are Android Programming using Kotlin and Team Programming. 
I'm really looking forward to seeing what my team and I will come up with. I know we'll learn a lot from one another. 
I just started a new job at Michigan Medicine, working in the HITS department (primarily focusing on device support at the moment) and trying to familiarize myself with IT.

I enjoy dancing, playing with my puppy, hiking, and cooking when I'm not feeling lazy. Thanks for reading!
