Hello My Name is Jonathan Taylor. I Started Attending WCC in Winter of 2019 with a Intro to Programming course. It seemed interesting and I've stuck with it. This will be my last semester at WCC and I hope to start 
Eastern in the Fall Semester. (I'm following that 3+1 Articulation agreement.) And Hopefully I get to Bring my 70+ Credits with me. I have a wife (Sarah) and we've been married for 3 years now. 
We got a dog right when the pandemic hit full tilt so, she'll be turning 2 in March. Charlie the King Cavilier (spelling?). 
I like to play video games, read, watch tv. All around an In-Doors person. Except when it comes to the great lakes. Could Spend all Day out there.
