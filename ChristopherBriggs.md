Hello my name is Christopher Briggs and I'm currently in this class, as well as Java Server Programming in order to finish my
Java Associates' Degree as well as my C++ Associates' Degree. This will be my last semester at Washtenaw as I plan on transferring
to the University of Michigan next fall.
My favorite hobbies included playing video games and watching Youtube. Some of my favorite games I've been playing are Terraria and CS:GO.
I also enjoy hiking and camping, but preferably when there is not a foot of snow on the ground.
